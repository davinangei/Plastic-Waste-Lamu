# Plastic-Waste-Lamu
A curated dataset of plastic waste images as well as a custom ensemble machine learning model.

This project report, details the curation of a novel plastic waste dataset and the development of a high-performing machine learning classification model based on this dataset.

There are five main files in this repo:
1. Baseline - contains code for the development of a baseline
2. Trees - contains code for the development of decision tree and random forest models
3. Kernels - contains code for the development of support vector machine models
4. CNNs - contains code for the development of convolutional neural network models
5. Model ensemble - contains code for the final models as well as the ensembling code
